> **Open-source tools that feel light, run fast, and respect your space.**

---

**Project Marvlock** is a developer-first, privacy-focused open-source collective.  
We build tools for students, indie hackers, and curious minds â€” lightweight, self-hostable, and forever free.

We believe:
- Small ideas can spark big change.
- Tools should be elegant, not overwhelming.
- Code should be a place of learning, not friction.
- Everyone deserves to build, share, and learn without surveillance or gatekeeping.

Whether you're:
- A student learning to contribute  
- A dev tired of bloated alternatives  
- A privacy-conscious builder  

**You're welcome here.**
